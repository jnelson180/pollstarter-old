Project / Root Folder - The project directory. This directory contains:

app/common      - This directory will contain common JS functions that will be used
                  across more than one of our controllers.

app/config      - The directory containing configuration files for Passport.

app/models      - Directory for database models. In this case, this is where the
                  Mongoose schemas will be defined. These models are definitions of
                  desired data structure that will be inserted into the database.

app/controllers - Directory for client and server-side controller files.
                  Controllers are used to either manipulate / modify the view
                  or the model (i.e. the database).

app/routes      - This folder contains route files. Routes give directions on
                  what to do when a particular URL or HTTP request is made from
                  the client (i.e. browser) to the server.

public          - This directory contains information used to render the view
                  (i.e. css & images). Traditionally, this directory would also
                  include a library of any vendor code
                  (i.e. AngularJS, jQuery, etc) used in the application.

public/css      - Contains the style sheet(s) for the application

public/img      - Contains any images used in the view (i.e. the Clementine.js logo)
